# Red Sea Markup Language
??? warning "Breaking API and Language Changes"
    This documentation refers to RSML v2.0.0+. RSML has changed a **lot** from v1.x.x *(a.k.a. Legacy RSML)* to v2.0.0.

**Red Sea Markup Language** is **the** powerful and robust fork of [MF's CrossRoad Solution](https://mf366-dev.github.io/documentation/mfroad/mfroad_1.0.html "MFRoad"), a language designed to **dynamically interpret different logic paths based on the local host OS and CPU architecture**.

RSML *(short for Red Sea Markup Language)* can currently be used directly in C# and Python, as well as in its own CLI. We are currently working in the native C ABI as well, which will let you use RSML in whatever programming language you like (as long as it allows for C interop).

## Useful Links
To further enhance your experience with RSML, we offer a list of useful links in this journey through our logic-heavy markup language.
