# RSML Implementations
Anyone can implement their own RSML parser and evaluator, but one should do their best to ensure that it adheres to the RSML specification as closely as possible.

Furthermore, it's highly recommended to inform the implementation's users about the level of compliance with the RSML specification, including any known limitations or deviations.

## Compliance
For an implementation to be 100% compliant with RSML's specification, it must define: all special actions defined in the specification and no more than those; comments exactly as specified; logic paths with the same syntax, structure and overloads; arguments with the same meaning and functionality; same semantics.
