# Conventions
This page explains several conventions used throughout this documentation.

## <!-- md:version --> - Version { data-toc-label="Version" }
The tag symbol in conjunction with a version number denotes when a specific behavior or version was implemented.
If the feature goes through extreme breaking changes, the version it was implemented in will be considered as the version
in which it suffered said changes.

**Example Usage:**

<!-- md:version 1.0.1 --> - a stable version

<!-- md:version 2.0.0-prerelease8 --> - a pre-release

## <!-- md:experimental --> - Experimental Feature { data-toc-label="Experimental Feature" }
Some newer features (or features implemented in pre-releases) are considered experimental, meaning they
have been less thoroughly tested or can be changed at any time (including complete removal).

## <!-- md:utility --> - External Utility { data-toc-label="External Utility" }
There might be some features that can be extended via the use of external utilities trusted by OceanApocalypseStudios.
