* ❓ So why use this standard?
Use this standard when you want:
- [X] *Simplicity.* Since ~official-25~ only defines the absolutely necessary, you don't waste time learning specific features.
- [X] *Recognition.* Since ~official-25~ is, as the same implies, official and is also the default standard used by the RSML parser, it's also the most widely recognized standard.
- [X] *CLI compatibility.* You can run a parser with this standard directly in the CLI.

However, you may want to use a different parser if you want:
- [ ] *Features.* ~official-25~ is quite limited in terms of features - it doesn't even have any *special actions*.
- [ ] *Custom operators (and/or actions).* If you don't like this standard's operators (and/or actions), you might want to customize them.
