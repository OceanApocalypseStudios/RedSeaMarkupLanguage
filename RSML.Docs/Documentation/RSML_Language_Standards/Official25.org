* üõ† Operators
~official-25~ makes use of all the three operators, as indicated below.

| Operator       | Definition as specified by ~official-25~ |
|----------------+----------------------------------------|
| =->=             | Primary Operator                       |
| 2 pipe symbols | Secondary Operator                     |
| =^!=             | Tertiary Operator                      |

* üí° Main Actions
~official-25~ defines all three actions, as it's mandatory to do so (otherwise, an error is thrown).

| Operator Type | Action that's performed                   |
|---------------+-------------------------------------------|
| Secondary     | Outputs the value suceeding it.           |
| Tertiary      | Throws an error with a specified message. |

#+begin_quote
^ Primary operator has been omitted as it can't be redefined - it's always the return operator.
#+end_quote

* üéØ Special Actions
~official-25~ does not define any special action.

#+begin_quote
=@EndAll= is already built-in.
#+end_quote

* ‚ùì So why use this standard?
Use this standard when you want:
- [X] *Simplicity.* Since ~official-25~ only defines the absolutely necessary, you don't waste time learning specific features.
- [X] *Recognition.* Since ~official-25~ is, as the same implies, official and is also the default standard used by the RSML parser, it's also the most widely recognized standard.
- [X] *CLI compatibility.* You can run a parser with this standard directly in the CLI.

However, you may want to use a different parser if you want:
- [ ] *Features.* ~official-25~ is quite limited in terms of features - it doesn't even have any *special actions*.
- [ ] *Custom operators (and/or actions).* If you don't like this standard's operators (and/or actions), you might want to customize them.
