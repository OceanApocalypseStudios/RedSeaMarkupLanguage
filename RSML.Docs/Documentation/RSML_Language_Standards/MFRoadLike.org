* ❓ So why use this standard?
Use this standard when you want:
- [X] *Simplicity.* Since ~mfroad-like~ only defines the absolutely necessary, you don't waste time learning specific features.
- [X] *Easy migration.* If you're coming from MFRoad, this is the closest standard you'll have to it.

However, you may want to use a different parser if you want:
- [ ] *Features.* ~mfroad-like~ is quite limited in terms of features - it doesn't even have any *special actions*.
- [ ] *Custom operators (and/or actions).* If you don't like this standard's operators (and/or actions), you might want to customize them.
