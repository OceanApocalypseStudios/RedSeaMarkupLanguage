* ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
This is the official documentation module for the *Red Sea Markup Language Standards*. But firstly: what are the Language Standards?

* ðŸ¤” What are the Language Standards?
The language standards is the list of *offically recognized* special actions, operators and action behaviors.

Since by using *RSML for C#* you can define your custom behaviors, it's important to specify whether your RSML snippet/file is written according to the standards specified in this documentation or according to another standard - or maybe your own standard...

The recommended way to specify the language standard you're using is the following:
#+begin_src python
# !standard: <name-of-standard>
# the rest of your file goes here
#+end_src

The codename of the official standard is: *official-25*.

While this isn't used by the parser, it's helpful for people so they can easily identify the language standard you're writing your Red Sea file in.
