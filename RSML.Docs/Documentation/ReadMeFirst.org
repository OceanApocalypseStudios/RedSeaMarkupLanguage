#+DESCRIPTION: The welcome page for the RSML Documentation.

* ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
This is the official documentation for *RSML* (Red Sea Markup Language), *the* modern fork of MFRoad, but up to ten times better.

* ðŸ”§ How to Build
To build this documentation, simply run =RSML.Docs.exe= or =RSML.Docs=. Yea, it's *that* easy.

You may also specify a custom build filetype (such as *PDF (with LaTeX)*):

#+begin_src bash
# These ones stand for PDF
>> RSML.Docs pdf
>> RSML.Docs latex

# These ones, Markdown
>> RSML.Docs markdown
>> RSML.Docs mdown

# HTML is default so you don't need to specify it
>> RSML.Docs html
#+end_src

* ðŸ‘‰ Start Here
Below, you can find a selection of recommended documentation pages to start with.
