* ðŸ¤” After installing
#+begin_quote
This guide assumes you've already installed RSML.CLI and RSML for Python.

#+begin_quote
Keep in mind ~rsml-python~ is a lot more limited than its C# counterpart. For example, you may only use *2* different language standards (~official-25~ and ~mfroad-like~).
#+end_quote

Let's start. To begin your script, you must import RSML.

#+begin_src python
import rsml_python as rsml
#+end_src

Make sure you have an executable to point to, as well.

#+begin_src python
import rsml_python as rsml

RSML_PATH: str = "path/to/cli"
#+end_src

RSML for Python has a OOP approach, so we must initialize 2 things: the executable and the document.

#+begin_src python
executable = RedSeaCLIExecutable(RSML_PATH)

document = RedSeaDocument()
#+end_src

Our document exists, but is empty. Let's load from a string.

#+begin_src python
my_doc: str = '''win.* -> "Windows"
(arch|ubuntu|debian).* -> "Linux"
osx.+ -> "MacOS or something"
.+ -> "Unknown"
'''

document.load_from_string(my_doc)
#+end_src

We now feed the document into the executable and retrieve output.

#+begin_src python
executable.load_document(document)

output = executable.evaluate_document() # non-prettified output
#+end_src

We may not print the output, if we want.

Here's the whole script:

#+begin_src python
# Importing
import rsml_python as rsml

# Executable
RSML_PATH: str = "path/to/cli"
executable = RedSeaCLIExecutable(RSML_PATH)

# Document
document = RedSeaDocument()
my_doc: str = '''win.* -> "Windows"
(arch|ubuntu|debian).* -> "Linux"
osx.+ -> "MacOS or something"
.+ -> "Unknown"
'''

document.load_from_string(my_doc)

# Output
executable.load_document(document)

output = executable.evaluate_document() # non-prettified output
print(output) # printing
#+end_src

* ðŸ“œ Reference Sheets
You'll find the reference sheets for *RSML for Python* in this very same documentation module. Why don't you start with the [[file:Reference_RedSeaCLIExecutable.org][~RedSeaCLIExecutable~]]

* ðŸ‘€ In Conclusion
Hopefully, this documentation module helped you in setting up your development environment for RSML in Python. If you have doubts, feel free to expose them: you may contact me via [[mailto:real_mf366@yahoo.com][this link]] (or just send an email to ~real_mf366@yahoo.com~).
